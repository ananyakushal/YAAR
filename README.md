We are creating a budgeting app primarily for students, with a task-based feature to manage daily tasks in addition to finances. Expenses will be categorized by type, such as food, education, and transportation. Users can set a budget for each category, and monitor spending to ensure they stay within budget.

The app will also include a task section, where users can create to-do lists and link any related expenses to their budget.

Features:

- Finance and money management:
    - Category-based budgets: Users can set a budget for each category, and transfer funds between categories if necessary.
    - Category-based spending: Users can group expenses under specific categories, and track their spending within those categories.
    - Category spend analysis: Users can view bar graphs, pie charts, and other data representations of their spending and income.
    - Contribution tracker: Users can track their contributions to group purchases, and any money owed to or from friends and family.
- Task and time management:
    - Task creation: Users can create and organize tasks, set due dates, and assign priorities.
    - Task categories and labels: Users can categorize tasks or add labels for better organization.
    - Task reminder and notifications: Users can receive reminders and notifications about upcoming or overdue tasks.
    - Task progress tracking: Users can track the progress of their tasks and mark them as completed.
    - Task comments and attachments: Users can add comments, attach files, or leave notes on specific tasks.
- Additional features:
    - Reward system for staying under budget or completing tasks.
    - Dark and light mode.
    - User accounts: Users can create accounts and log in securely to access their task and money management data from multiple devices.

Possible names for the app include Money-Minded, TimeWallet, and TimeWiseFin. The font used will be Mali.
